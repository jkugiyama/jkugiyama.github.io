# A Love Story With AI
Artificial Intelligence or AI has grown significantly in recent years and gained popularity amongst students. Anyone is able to copy a question and paste it into an AI generative tool such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, and then receive a fairly accurate answer. With a process as simple as this, these generative AI tools basically become the student. However, there are students that make the most out of these generative AI tools, instead of copying and pasting questions and getting answers. Things such as proofreading an essay, or generating a study set for an exam, or even planning out a daily routine for someone. 

# Personal Experience
## Experience WODs
For experience WODS, I avoided using any AI as I did not have a need to find an answer in a given time. For most of them, an instructional video was provided, which allowed for me to look back on and guide me through these experience WODs. 

### In-class Practice WODs
At first, I tried to avoid using AI during the in-class practice WODs, but after the first two I decided to include the usage of AI in order to finish within the given time.

### In-class WODs
Similarly to the practice WODs, I tried avoiding the usage of AI, but after the first two and a little bit of encouragement to make use of AI, I decided it would be worth it for the sake of my grade and learning. I feel that being able to properly use AI will continue to be a practice that surfaces often, especially with the rapid growth of AI. Being able to incorporate it into our coding, will only help us get faster results.

### Essays
For essays, I did not use any AI because I felt that it would not be expressing my views and opinions. 

### Final project
For the final project, I used AI to explain the errors I was getting while working on it. I did not use it explicitly to write a function, rather to help fix what was wrong with it.

### Learning a concept / tutorial
When it comes to learning a concept, I didn’t use AI. Instead I looked up other videos to aid my learning and explain things I could not quite understand.

### Answering a question in class or in Discord
I did not use AI to answer a question in class or Discord.

### Asking or answering a smart-question
I normally looked up the smart-question through online resources first, but if I was unsuccessful, then I resorted to AI to answer the question.

### Coding example
I have used AI before to provide a coding example for concepts I did not fully understand, such as functional programming.

### Explaining code
I have used AI to explain code, especially when a line was giving an error or not working correctly. It would normally provide the reasoning as to why the code was not working and offer help to resolve the problem.

### Writing code
I also have used AI to write code, more specifically code within the WODs.

### Documenting code
I have not used AI to document code, rather I normally documented it myself to ensure I understood the purpose of a line of code.

### Quality assurance
I often used AI for quality assurance, especially with ESLint errors as they appeared often.

### Other uses in ICS 314 not listed
One specific thing I used AI for in ICS 314 that was not listed, was to compare two different languages for a function, as sometimes different languages were used in the instructions and the instructional videos.


# Impact on Learning and Understanding
AI has certainly influenced my learning experience in this class. It helped guide me through WODs, providing quick and efficient solutions. AI has enhanced my learning, preparing for time crunch situations and being able to work under pressure


## Practical Applications
AI has made significant strides in real-world projects and simulations within software engineering. Tools like GitHub Copilot are transforming coding practices by offering real-time suggestions, error detection, and optimization, allowing students to write code more efficiently. AI-powered collaborative platforms, such as hackathons, help students work on real-world problems and integrate AI into their solutions. In industry, AI is used for automating code reviews, detecting vulnerabilities, and predicting defects, demonstrating its potential to improve productivity and accuracy in software development. AI tools are effective in increasing efficiency and reducing errors but require human oversight for maximum impact.

## Challenges and Opportunities
AI in software engineering education faces challenges like bias and over-reliance on tools. AI systems can inherit biases, which may affect code generation and bug detection. Students may also depend too heavily on AI, which could hinder their understanding of core principles. However, AI offers opportunities for personalized learning by adapting to students' strengths and weaknesses. It can also provide automated feedback, allowing instructors to focus on interactive teaching. AI fosters collaboration in projects, enabling students to work on real-world challenges together, enhancing their skills.

## Comparative Analysis
Traditional software engineering education emphasizes lectures and exercises that provide a solid theoretical foundation but may lack engagement and real-world exposure. AI-enhanced approaches offer real-time feedback and adapt to students' needs, making learning more dynamic. While traditional methods foster deep understanding, AI tools help students develop practical skills faster by providing automated solutions. AI-driven learning increases engagement, knowledge retention, and real-world problem-solving, whereas traditional methods may be slower in developing these aspects.

## Future Considerations
AI’s future role in software engineering education includes advanced intelligent tutoring systems that guide students through problem-solving, offering tailored resources and feedback. AI can help personalize curricula, ensuring students learn at their own pace. It can also align education with industry trends, keeping it relevant to fields like machine learning and cloud computing. Challenges such as ethical concerns and data privacy must be addressed, but AI’s potential to foster critical thinking, creativity, and collaboration in education is promising.

## Conclusion
AI is transforming software engineering education by enhancing engagement, efficiency, and practical skills. While challenges like over-reliance and bias exist, the benefits of personalized learning, real-world applications, and collaboration are significant. As AI evolves, it will continue to shape education, preparing students for the future of software development with greater interactivity and relevance.
