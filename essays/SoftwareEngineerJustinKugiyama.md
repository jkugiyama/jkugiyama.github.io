##  Connecting to the World of Technology

I can not say I have always been interested in the world of technology. Throughout my childhood, I was always around sports. From playing basketball and volleyball, to watching my brother play baseball or my sister cheerleading. I am not saying I did not use any technology as a kid, I just preferred to be outside. Flash forward to my seventh grade year, it was then I started getting into technology. I found myself joining a project where we worked with solar powered RC cars. That experience sparked the interest I had for technology. Entering my freshman year I got a PS4 and that is when the technology world took me in. Obsessed with video games, I wanted to learn more about how they ran and just play them daily. 



## One Day or Day One

While some hated the COVID-19 pandemic and being stuck inside, I thrived through it. Logging into Zoom meetings, while playing video games was the dream. I will admit, it was not healthy nor good for my education. But that is in the past and I can not change that. Along with that, I was able to get into building my own PC. This helped pique my interests in computer science and computers in general, but I was not fully committed to learning that in college. I attended Kapiolani Community College with the intent to only get my general education prerequisites out of the way, then later on transfer to University of Hawaii at Manoa. I would shortly find out that this would not work in my favor if I wanted to major in Computer Science, since there are prerequisites within the Computer Science track that I needed to take. I decided to major in Computer Science after my first semester, and now I am here. 

## Taking Things One Step at a Time

While these past two years of Computer Science have been smooth sailing, I am still worried about internships and job searching. I have not been successful in attaining an internship this past summer, but I will put the blame on myself for that as I did not put myself out there and only applied to a few. I am an overthinker, so I tend to plan for the worst. Besides that, in the near future I hope to develop skills in and learn more about data processing and hone my programming skills. I am sure the next courses in the program will contribute to that, and will prepare me for what is to come. Whatever life may throw at me, I will gladly take it face on and do my best.
