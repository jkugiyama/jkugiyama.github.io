## Reflecting on Software Engineering: Beyond Web Application Development

Throughout this journey through ICS 314, I underwent many stressful weeks, tackling the heavy workload that awaited me daily. In this course, I learned not only how to build web applications, but also fundamental software engineering principles that I may often be exposed to on any type of software project. I would say that all concepts we covered were important in my journey through software engineering, but three concepts that stood out to me were Functional Programming, Coding Standards, and Agile Project Management. These three were valuable beyond web development and offered insight into broader software engineering practices.

## Functional Programming

Functional Programming uses simple, pure functions and avoids changing data to make code easier to understand, maintain, and scale. Functional programming focuses on what a program should do, rather than how it does it, unlike imperative programming. It’s especially useful in fields like data science and AI, where precision and reliability are key. By using functional programming, engineers can write cleaner code, simplify debugging, and create more reliable, efficient applications.
## Coding Standards

Although the course focused on web development, I've learned that coding standards are important for all projects. They ensure consistency, readability, and maintainability, which are key for long-term success. Following these standards also helps with collaboration, reduces bugs, and makes complex tasks easier. As I continue my journey, I’ll apply these principles to every project, ensuring my code is clean, efficient, and readable.

## Agile Project Management

Lastly, the concept I felt was the most important, Agile Project Management. When combined with Issue-Driven Project Management, the two focus on quickly addressing issues as they arise, breaking down larger problems into smaller, manageable tasks. By solving these smaller issues, teams can avoid conflicts and maintain efficiency. The approach promotes continuous collaboration and flexibility, ensuring projects stay on course even when new challenges appear. Whether in web development, infrastructure, or scientific research, Agile and Issue-Driven Project Management work together to help teams prioritize, deliver results, and keep progress moving forward.
