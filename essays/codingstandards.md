## What are Coding Standards?

From having a certain amount of spaces to indent, to only using single quotes for a string, a representation of characters like words or sentences, coding standards are like the parents reminding you to make your bed and to quit slouching. It is a software engineering technique used to help with formatting code neatly and maintaining a consistent way of coding. This practice helps to write code in a uniform manner and makes it more readable to allow for other programmers to follow along easier, as long as they themselves follow the same standards. A way to think of it is like writing an essay. Everyone writing an essay must follow proper indentation, puncuation, grammar, and spacing rules to help with structure and readability. 

## The Cheat Code to Learning a New Language?

Is coding standards the cheat code to learning a new coding language? I feel that, for certain languages, such as indentation based languages like Python, it can be effective. But thatâ€™s not the case for most languages, as they incorporate indentation and spacing for readability and cleanliness purposes. Both don't necessarily affect the output of the code, and programs can still function with improper puncuation and spacing. I feel that coding standards aren't the most important thing in terms of software engineering. The way someone formats their code can be viewed as a type of dialect when speaking. For example, in Japanese, there are many dialects where pronunciation and word usage differ. There is no right nor wrong, as that is just how their language evolved and changed throughout time. Along with that, if someone has a specific habit such as including a space after a curly bracket, it may help to differentiate their work from others. While I may not fully agree with the effectiveness of coding standards, I feel that it is an important skill to develop as it will help the flow for collaboration projects, and it is also a common practice in companies.

## Blast from the Past

I had worked with something similar in jGRASP in my previous computer science courses, where it would take note of the formatting errors and explain what each error was. For most of the time, it wasn't much of a hassle to deal with, as I would normally correct the errors as they appeared. That hasn't been the case with ESLint, the new format checking I have been working with this semester. I have been experiencing some techincal difficulties with having the errors appear as they are made. In order to see the errors, I have to close and reopen my VSCode application, and only then are they visible. If I am able to resolve the issue, I would have no problem with ESLint as it really isn't the hassle it may appear to be.
