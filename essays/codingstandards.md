## What are Coding Standards

From having a certain amount of spaces to indent, to only using single quotes for a string, a representation of characters like words or sentences, coding standards are like the parents reminding you to make your bed and to quit slouching. It is a software engineering technique used to help with formatting code neatly and maintaining a consistent way of coding. This practice helps to make code more readable and uniform to allow for other programmers to follow along easier, if they follow the same standards. A way to think of it is like writing an essay. Everyone must follow proper indentation, puncuation, grammar, and spacing rules. While I may not fully agree with the effectiveness of coding standards, I feel that it is an important skill to develop as it will help the flow for collaboration projects, and it is also a common practice in companies.

## The Cheat Code to Learning a New Language?

Is coding standards the cheat code to learning a new coding language? I feel that, for certain languages, such as indentation based languages like Python, it can be helpful. But thatâ€™s not the case for most languages, as they incorporate indentation for readability and cleanliness purposes. I feel that coding standards aren't the most important thing in terms of software engineering. The way someone formats their code can be viewed as a type of dialect when speaking. For example, in Japanese, there are many dialects where pronunciation and word usage differ. There is no right nor wrong, as that is just how their language evolved and changed throughout time. Along with that, if someone has a specific habit such as including a space after a curly bracket, it may help to differentiate their work from others. 

## Fix Your Posture

I had worked with something similar in Intellij for jGRASP in my previous computer science courses. For most of the time, it wasn't much of a hassle to deal with, as I would normally correct the errors as they appeared. However, with ESLint, I have been having some techincal difficulties with having the errors appear as they are made. In order to see the erros, I have to close and reopen my VSCode application, and only then are they visible. If I am able to resolve the issue, I would have no problem with ESLint as it really isn't the hassle it may appear to be.
